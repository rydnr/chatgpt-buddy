#+TITLE: ChatGPT-Buddy Development Journal
#+AUTHOR: Claude Code (Anthropic)
#+DATE: 2025-06-29

* Overview
This journal documents the challenges faced and solutions applied during the transformation of ChatGPT-Buddy from a traditional client-server architecture to a pure event-driven, domain-centric system following Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), and Hexagonal Architecture principles.

* Phase 1: Foundation & Shared Domain (Weeks 1-2)

** Challenge: Monorepo Structure Setup
*** Problem
- Converting existing project to pnpm workspace structure
- Managing dependencies across packages
- Setting up proper TypeScript configuration for each package

*** Solution Applied
- Created =pnpm-workspace.yaml= to define workspace structure
- Established clear package boundaries: core, server, extension, client-ts
- Used workspace protocol (=workspace:*=) for internal dependencies
- Configured TypeScript with strict settings and decorator support

*** Code Example
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
# pnpm-workspace.yaml
packages:
  - 'packages/*'
  - 'apps/*'
  - 'typescript-eda'
#+END_SRC

** Challenge: Event-Driven Architecture Design
*** Problem
- Defining shared domain events across all modules
- Ensuring type safety and serialization
- Creating base abstractions without over-engineering

*** Solution Applied
- Created abstract =Event= base class with required properties
- Implemented =PingEvent= and =PongEvent= with correlation IDs
- Added JSON serialization support for network transmission
- Used TypeScript interfaces for type safety

*** Code Example
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
export abstract class Event {
  public abstract readonly type: string;
  public abstract get correlationId(): string;
  public abstract get timestamp(): Date;
  public abstract toJSON(): Record<string, unknown>;
}
#+END_SRC

** Challenge: Test-Driven Development Discipline
*** Problem
- Maintaining strict TDD red-green-refactor cycle
- Creating meaningful tests for domain events
- Setting up proper test infrastructure

*** Solution Applied
- Always wrote failing tests first (ðŸ§ª commits)
- Implemented minimal code to pass tests (âœ… commits)
- Refactored for better design (ðŸš€ commits)
- Used Jest with TypeScript for all packages

*** Metrics
- 16 commits following TDD cycle
- 100% test coverage for core domain logic
- Clear commit message pattern with emojis

* Phase 2: Server Transformation (Weeks 3-4)

** Challenge: Domain Handler Implementation
*** Problem
- Separating domain logic from infrastructure concerns
- Creating handlers that process events correctly
- Maintaining correlation ID consistency

*** Solution Applied
- Created =PingHandler= in domain layer
- Kept business logic pure (no HTTP concerns)
- Used dependency injection patterns
- Preserved correlation IDs throughout flow

*** Code Example
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
export class PingHandler {
  public async handle(event: PingEvent): Promise<PongEvent> {
    const responseMessage = `Pong: ${event.payload.message}`;
    return new PongEvent({
      originalMessage: event.payload.message,
      responseMessage,
      correlationId: event.correlationId
    });
  }
}
#+END_SRC

** Challenge: HTTP Infrastructure Layer
*** Problem
- Creating Express endpoints that delegate to domain
- Proper error handling and validation
- Integration testing without mocking domain logic

*** Solution Applied
- Created =createApp()= function for testable Express setup
- Added request validation middleware
- Used supertest for HTTP integration testing
- Kept infrastructure layer thin

*** Code Example
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
app.post('/api/ping', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const pingEvent = new PingEvent({
    message: body.message,
    correlationId: body.correlationId
  });
  const pongEvent = await pingHandler.handle(pingEvent);
  res.status(200).json(pongEvent.toJSON());
});
#+END_SRC

* Phase 3: Browser Extension Development (Week 5-6)

** Challenge: Chrome Extension API Integration
*** Problem
- Mocking Chrome APIs for testing
- Handling browser-specific context
- Maintaining event-driven patterns in extension environment

*** Solution Applied
- Created Chrome API mocks in test setup
- Used jsdom test environment for DOM testing
- Implemented browser context detection with fallbacks
- Maintained same event handling patterns as server

*** Code Example
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
// Test setup for Chrome APIs
global.chrome = {
  runtime: {
    onMessage: { addListener: jest.fn() },
    sendMessage: jest.fn(),
    id: 'test-extension-id',
  },
  tabs: { sendMessage: jest.fn() }
} as any;
#+END_SRC

** Challenge: Extension Domain Logic
*** Problem
- Adapting domain patterns to browser extension context
- Including browser-specific information in responses
- Handling extension lifecycle safely

*** Solution Applied
- Created =ExtensionPingHandler= following same patterns
- Added browser context detection with error handling
- Used try-catch blocks for Chrome API access
- Maintained correlation ID consistency

* Phase 4: Client SDK Development (Week 7-8)

** Challenge: HTTP Client Implementation
*** Problem
- Creating clean SDK API for external consumers
- Handling HTTP errors and timeouts
- Mocking HTTP calls for unit testing

*** Solution Applied
- Created =ChatGPTBuddyClient= class with axios
- Added correlation ID generation
- Used axios mocking with Jest
- Provided simple async/await API

*** Code Example
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
export class ChatGPTBuddyClient {
  public async ping(message: string): Promise<PongResponse> {
    const correlationId = this.generateCorrelationId();
    const response = await this.httpClient.post('/api/ping', {
      message, correlationId
    });
    return response.data;
  }
}
#+END_SRC

** Challenge: Testing Strategy
*** Problem
- Isolating unit tests from integration concerns
- Mocking HTTP dependencies effectively
- Maintaining test reliability

*** Solution Applied
- Used Jest mocking for axios
- Created mock responses that match real API
- Tested correlation ID uniqueness
- Separated unit tests from integration tests

* Integration & Testing Challenges

** Challenge: End-to-End Testing Setup
*** Problem
- Testing complete flow across all modules
- Managing test server lifecycle
- Complex Jest configuration for workspace

*** Solution Applied
- Created integration test structure
- Used different ports for test servers
- Set up Jest configuration for workspace testing
- Created test utilities for server lifecycle

** Challenge: Workspace Dependencies
*** Problem
- Building packages in correct order
- Managing TypeScript compilation across packages
- Ensuring clean imports between packages

*** Solution Applied
- Used pnpm build filters for dependency order
- Built core package before dependent packages
- Used workspace references in TypeScript
- Created proper export/import patterns

* Key Solutions and Patterns Applied

** 1. Walking Skeleton Approach
- Started with simplest possible feature (ping-pong)
- Extended across all three modules gradually
- Maintained working system at each step

** 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- All communication through typed events
- Correlation IDs for request tracking
- JSON serialization for network transmission

** 3. Domain-Driven Design
- Pure domain logic in handler classes
- Infrastructure concerns separated
- Business rules centralized in domain layer

** 4. Hexagonal Architecture
- Clear port/adapter patterns
- Infrastructure depends on domain
- Domain has no infrastructure dependencies

** 5. Test-Driven Development
- Red-green-refactor cycle throughout
- High test coverage maintained
- Clear commit message patterns
